# GP01-assignment

The repo contains code as part of the GP-01 assignment.

- eq_course_scrapper.py : Scrapes the Equivalent CS courses offered by other universities for Semester Exchange
- moodle-scrapper.py : Scrapes the announcements made by TA for a course (works for the old moodle (2020-2022))

These 2 programs were written by me as part of the CS251 SSL course and have been modified slightly to get it into working condition
